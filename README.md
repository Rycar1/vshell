## Introduction

VShell is an open-source, **incomplete** re-implementation of the VShell C2 (Command & Control) management framework. It provides a web management panel, a multi-protocol C2 engine (HTTP/HTTPS, DNS, KCP, WebSocket/CDN), and an agent with remote terminal, screen streaming and plugin execution. The project was produced by decompiling and reimplementing the original Windows binary (`v_windows_amd64.exe`). Alignment is a work in progress: the [Reverse-Engineering Status](#reverse-engineering-status) section states exactly which modules are verified 1:1 against the binary and which are not.

## Features

| Module | Description |
|---|---|
| **Web panel** | Login auth, Basic Auth, JWT, dashboard, client/listener/task management, file upload/download, screen viewer |
| **C2 engine** | Multi-protocol listeners (HTTP/HTTPS, DNS, KCP, WebSocket/CDN); online monitoring, health checks, maintenance tasks |
| **Agent** | Remote terminal, screen streaming, plugin execution; VerifyKey + salt handshake |
| **Notifications** | DingTalk / WeChat Work bot alerts (optional) |
| **Persistence** | SQLite (web) + JSON (engine) dual storage |

## Quick Start

### 1. Build

```bash
# Server (Web + C2 Engine)
go build -o vshell-server .

# Agent (standalone module)
cd agent && go build -o agent.exe .
```

### 2. Configure

Create `conf/setting.conf` (see `generateConfigContent` in `utils/config.go` for the template):

```ini
master_type=web              # web / gui / all
web_port=8082
web_ip=0.0.0.0
web_basic_auth=true          # blocks mass-asset discovery scanners
web_username=admin
web_password=<your-strong-password>   # empty → random password generated at startup
web_jwt_secret=              # empty → random secret per process
```

> **Security note**: If `setting.conf` is absent, a random admin password is generated at startup and printed to the log. **No hardcoded credentials exist in the codebase.** Always change the default configuration after deployment.

### 3. Run

```bash
./vshell-server
# Open in browser: http://<ip>:8082/login
```

### 4. Build the Agent with injected config

Agent connection settings are injected at compile time via `ldflags` (matching `ServerAddr`, `VerifyKey`, `EncryptSalt` in `agent/main.go`):

```bash
cd agent
go build -ldflags "\
  -X main.ServerAddr=REPLACE_SERVER_ADDR___XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX \
  -X main.VerifyKey=REPLACE_VERIFY_KEY___XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX \
  -X main.EncryptSalt=REPLACE_ENCRYPT_SALT_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX" \
  -o agent.exe .
```

### 5. Create a listener

Listeners are created dynamically through the web panel API (`c2engine.NewListener(listenAddr, connectAddr, mode, verifyKey, encryptSalt, remark)`). Supported modes: `http` / `https` / `dns` / `kcp` / `websocket` (CDN).

## Reverse-Engineering Status

> This project reverse-engineers the original Windows binary (`v_windows_amd64.exe`, garble-obfuscated Go) **top-down**: every module is aligned 1:1 with its Ghidra decompilation, no invented implementations. Alignment is never finished, so this section states what is verified and what is not.

### Verified against the binary (1:1 aligned and test-covered)

| Module | Aligned content | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| `c2engine/storage.go` | SQL layer (clients/listeners/hosts/tasks) field-for-field with the decompiled SQL | runtime DB schema diff |
| `c2engine/wire.go` | 24-byte typed-field frames (kind byte + flags + 3 dwords) | unit tests |
| `c2engine/channel_frame.go` | Channel/tunnel frame protocol (FUN_011b4040/011b5600/011b5b40) | 6 tests |
| `c2engine/dns.go` | DNS channel = Go std base32 (no padding); query = `[8B agent ID][message].domain` | tests |
| `c2engine/kcp.go`, `protocol.go`, `engine.go` | KCP/protocol/listener dispatch; check-in now carries the agent's arch | tests |
| `c2engine/listener.go` | Message frames opened as `<u32 LE len><[12B nonce][ct][16B GCM tag]>` | captured-frame test |
| `c2engine/stream_hub.go` | Terminal/screen relay to panel viewers (screen frames zlib-compressed) | hub + WebSocket tests |
| `controllers/*` | Login/client/listener/tunnel/file/download/screenshot/runner controllers | endpoint tests |
| `router/`, `utils/` | Routing, auth (401 on missing/invalid token), config, license, notifications | tests |
| `agent/` | Message-frame crypto, the `FUN_010952e0` opcode dispatcher, terminal/screen relay clients | 13 opcodes + crypto tests |

### Cracked artifacts

- **Message frame**: `wire = <u32 LE len><[12B nonce][ct][16B tag]>`, AES-256-GCM.
  Key is **derived per deployment**: `key = hex.EncodeToString(md5(EncryptSalt))`
  (32 ASCII chars used verbatim). Verified by opening a captured frame to
  the 9-byte plaintext (four zero bytes then `4.9.3`); the raw 16-byte digest and
  a zero-padded digest both fail the GCM tag, so the discriminator is the tag, not
  the key length.
- **GCM parameters** (nonce 12 at offset 0, no AAD, tag 16): established by
  exhaustive search over nonce size 8-20 x offset 0-4 x AAD in {none, nonce} x tag
  size 8-20 against a captured frame — exactly one configuration authenticates it.
  This is *inferred from the capture*, not read out of the binary: garble keeps no
  `crypto/aes`/`crypto/cipher` symbol names, only their error strings.
- **`FUN_010952e0` dispatcher**: command byte 8 of the 24-byte task record is the
  opcode; the switch jumps on `opcode - 1` (`DEC R9; CMP R9,0x2a; JA default;
  JMP [0x1dc31e40 + R9*8]`, verified in the disassembly at 0x1095828). The jump
  table at `0x1dc31e40` has **43 entries**, two of which (opcodes 0x05 and 0x19)
  point at the default branch, so **41 opcodes have real handlers**; the arg is a
  4-byte big-endian int (`FUN_00fc1620`). An earlier revision of this file claimed
  39 reachable opcodes with 0x04/0x08/0x18 dead — that came from reading decompiled
  *case numbers* as opcode bytes, and is wrong: `case K` is opcode K+1, and 0x04,
  0x08 and 0x18 all have handlers.
- **Obfuscated string pools**: garble's per-package pools decode as
  `plaintext = dst_blob - src_blob` (bytewise, mod 256) over a fixed length; the
  loader is `0x116d020`, the decode site `0x116d0c2`, e.g. 0x9aff bytes giving
  SQLite's pragma-name array. **Corrected:** the 67-record table at `0x1e302680`
  is NOT a command-name table and its 3-byte field is NOT an offset into a
  decoder — it is SQLite's `sqlite3Pragma` list (from the embedded
  modernc.org/sqlite), rewritten at load by `0x117b989`, containing zero
  relocations. The per-opcode constants live in a different, not-yet-located
  pool.
- **Obfuscated string chain** (`po`/`decFunc`): a permutation chain whose per-step
  operation is class-dependent; recovered byte-exactly
  (`"stageless/ebpf_%s_%s"`, `"windows_amd64.exe"`).
- **SPA wire contracts**: `/runner/runplugin` takes `pluginName`/`procArg`; screen
  `quality` is `"big"/"normal"/"small"`; screenshot returns bare base64;
  `/download/*` return raw binary bodies with `Content-Disposition`/`Content-Type`.
- **Older findings kept for reference**: server AES-128 `FUN_0053a1e0`; login
  password = `web_password` verbatim -> JWT; client struct (22 fields @ 0x1bb9580).
- **Corrected**: `0x458f00` is a garble string/field-name decryptor (rdx = 0x8e2240
  string table, inputs are JSON field names), **not** a message cipher. The earlier
  keystream/CBC-chain model and the `msgFrameKey` constant were both wrong; the
  constant was a guess that had been written into the source, and it appears nowhere
  in `v_windows_amd64.exe`.

### Not yet recovered

| Item | Status |
|---|---|
| Most of the 41 `FUN_010952e0` opcodes | Report `not implemented` — their client-state fields and result-frame encodings have no counterpart yet. Frame emitters: `FUN_0100d160`/`FUN_0100d440`/`FUN_0100d5e0` |
| Per-opcode string constants | Not in the table previously believed to hold them (that one is SQLite pragma names). They live in a second, not-yet-located garble pool whose loader is absent; the decoder geometry for the located pools is recovered (`c2engine/string_decrypt.go`) |
| `FUN_0194d140` background services | Constant-based branches unaligned; `AppBackground` covers the license/`licTime` path only |
| Download payload bytes | Labeled a **known deviation**: templates are fetched through the listener at request time, config values are per-listener, and the argv key is unrecovered. Two placeholders are documented in-source (`PoArgvSeed`, argv entry key) |
| Embedded agent binaries | Not statically extractable — Go fills the per-file `{ptr, len}` records from `init` via `loaduintptr` |
| Screen quality -> parameter mapping | Unlocated; the values in `screenCaptureParams` and the zlib level are marked PLACEHOLDER in-source |
| Agent-side `runplugin` handler | Absent; `/runner/runplugin` therefore does its pre-flight checks and dispatches nothing |
| `FUN_017019c0` state-machine strings | Deeply encrypted; static solving abandoned |
| `FUN_011a02e0`/`01564720` decrypt stubs | Static solve blocked |

### Deliberate divergences from the original

- **License failure**: the original aborts the process via `FUN_005ecc00`; this
  implementation falls back to the `FUN_0194cd00` defaults. Documented in
  `controllers/engine.go` and asserted by `background_test.go`.
- **License key**: the original RSA private key is not included, so the server runs
  with inferred license values (`public`, `20990101`, 99 clients, VIP).
- **Agent generation**: payloads are built here rather than patched from embedded
  templates, because those templates could not be extracted.
## Known Limitations

> Because this is an **incomplete** reverse-engineering effort, the following may differ from the original:

- **License validation**: the original RSA private key is **not** included; without it the server runs in "observation mode" with inferred license values (`LicenseName=public, LimitClient=99, VIP=true`).
- **Frontend assets**: the SPA in `static/` was extracted from the original binary; some form defaults may differ.
- **Agent behavior**: platform-specific code (process hiding, persistence, etc.) is a minimal implementation.
- **Protocol compatibility**: interop with the official server/client is **not guaranteed**; intended for independent research only.
